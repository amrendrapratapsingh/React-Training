HTML - StateLess
Ex: Agent Registration

React
UI Framework - It is meant for UI. In terms of MVC framework, people consider react as View.
We can design interactive screens.
All business logic can be written in Javascript

React - JS + JSX (which is similar to HTML)
DOM - Document object model
Virtual DOM

<label>User Name</label>
<TextBox> </TextBox>


DOM - Initial Screen

<Label></Label>
<Button></Button>
<Div></Div>



DOM - After Clicking of Button
<Label></Label>
<Button></Button>
<Div>
	<Container1></Container1>
	<Container2></Container2>
</Div>

Disadvantages 
	It refreshes screen completely and affects performance

React
	Maintains 2 copies 
		DOM
		Virtual DOM
	After Clicking of Button
		Virtual DOM is recreated completely
		Merged with orignial DOM and update UI with modified nodes ie process happens backend only and User will have higer Transistion time.
		Ex: Game - Movement of vehicle in Real Dom and complete Nodes recalculated in Virtual Dom
			Component -
				Vehicle
				Road
				Background
State
	Complete Page Level
	Component Level
